# Drawing Canvas

Create an develop a drawing app with NodeJS. The idea is to set up the application that a canvas allows multiple users to draw things they want with the app, usign websockets. For a seamless interface, add HTML and CSS that allow users to draw and style it while handling the mouse events while drawing. You can also create the server-side code to see when the user joins and start drawing.
